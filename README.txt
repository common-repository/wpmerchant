Powerful and simple way to collect payments on your website using Stripe.

== Description ==
WPMerchant is a Stripe Plugin for WordPress that allows you to collect Money/Bitcoin with a Buy Button in 3 Simple Steps:
1) Connect to Stripe (your Payment Processor)
2) Create a Product
3) Add the WPMerchant Buy Button shortcode to your post or page

It's FREE and it's really that easy!

We built WPMerchant to empower others by simplifying the setup process that you experience with other Stripe WordPress plugins. All you have to do is either login to or create a Stripe account and then retrieve your API keys. This allows you to start collecting payments from your customers much faster than other Stripe WordPress plugins.

We believe that anyone should be able get started using Stripe's simple, effective, and innovative payment processing technology to sell their products online. We built WPMerchant to reflect that and as a result made it as simple as possible so that you can start receiving payments from customers in as little as a minute (don't believe us, check out the video below).  

You also don't have to worry about PCI compliance, as Stripe does it for you. You just need a web host that enables https connections via an SSL certificate. We highly recommend using [WPLauncher](https://www.wplauncher.com), it is our top rated WordPress host. 

We wanted customers to have the quickest possible fully integrated purchase flow (customers aren't redirected to another site, or to another page even); so that you don't have to pay $200, $300, $400, or $500+ per year to keep your premium extensions updated; AND, most importantly, so that anyone can leverage Stripe Payments to start making money today by selling products/widgets/etc using the WPMerchant Stripe Plugin for WordPress. WPMerchant is the quickest, easiest, and most effective way to create an online store that produces sales using Stripe Payments.

= Simple Stripe Checkout for Customers =
Customers don't have to use the outdated flow of adding an item to a cart, viewing the cart, and then finally proceeding to checkout - geesh.  We use Stripe Checkout to make our customer checkout process as simple as possible to give you a better chance at converting a lead into a sale! After clicking on your custom WPMerchant Buy Button, your customer can purchase a single product, multiple products, or a product bundle.  As such, your customers can check out much faster than on competing e-commerce plugins - which means the money gets into your pocket fast.

= Best in Class Setup Process =
We pride ourselves on providing the easiest on-boarding experience of any Stripe Plugin for WordPress. You can connect to Stripe (a payment processor) by simply finding your API keys and adding them to WPMerchant's settings page. And, you can connect to MailChimp (a mailing list/newsletter provider) using your username and password instead of searching for API Keys (leave that junk to us!).  

Again, Collect Money with a WPMerchant Buy Button in just [3 easy steps](https://www.wpmerchant.com/install):
1) Connect to Stripe (Payment Processor)
2) Create a Product
3) Add the WPMerchant Buy Button to your post or page

If you already have a Stripe account, this can take you 1 minute or less to set up ([don't believe us - check it out](https://www.wpmerchant.com/1-minute-setup)). If you don't have a Stripe account, it will likely take you around 5 minutes to set up.

If you want to subscribe a user to your MailChimp Mailing List on successful purchase, connect to MailChimp as well.

= Simplicty in Everything =
We try to simplify the whole process; from connecting to Stripe (payment processor) and MailChimp (mailing list providers), to creating products, to managing products, to managing orders, to analyzing sales, to increasing sales, etc.  We want to make your life easier than all of the other eCommerce plugins and platforms out there.  We are always striving to simplify; [shoot us over any ideas you may have](http://www.wpmerchant.com).

= Fully Integrated Payment Processor =
We want your site to be taken seriously and to look as professional as possible.  Therefore, while our competitors offer product checkout through offsite payment providers like PayPal for free, we are providing you with a FREE fully integrated and simple payment processor in Stripe Checkout.  This means that your customers never leave your site; which makes it incredibly easy for them to purchase your product(s) immediately. 

= Mailing List Integration =
When a product is purchased, your customer is charged for that product and is automatically subscribed to the MailChimp list that you provide.  

= Growth Tips =
We're passionate about helping you find leads and convert those leads into sales. We'll share our tips and tricks to getting more traffic to your site and to analyzing that traffic to get more sales.  In addition to extensive experience building websites (on WordPress and in custom environments) for clients and for ourselves, we founded a company called [TemplateLauncher](https://www.templatelauncher.com) that focuses on building high end landing pages for LeadPages.net customers.  We want to help anyone improve their sales funnel to get more leads and to get more sales. We might give you a free landing page if you're lucky!

= Service Oriented =
We make customer service a priority.  If you have a problem, you can send us a service request through the plugin. If you can't find where to submit it, send it [here](http://www.wpmerchant.com).

= Premium Versions at a Lower Cost =
Sick of paying $200, $300, $400, $500+ dollars every year on updating extensions with other e-commerce or Stripe WordPress plugins. 
We offer additional premium versions of WPMerchant at much more affordable prices than our competitors.  

We have a deal going on currently that if you get an annual hosting plan at [Blog.WPLauncher.com/hosting](https://blog.wplauncher.com/hosting?ref=wpmerchant_plugin "Hosting with WPLauncher"), we will give you WPMerchant Professional and WPMerchant Membership for FREE.
